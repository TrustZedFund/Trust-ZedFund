  <h1>Trust ZedFund</h1>
  <p>
    Trust ZedFund is a community-focused financial platform for Zambians.
    We exist to help individuals and communities understand money, save together responsibly,
    and support real projects — without being a bank, without promising returns,
    and without forcing participation.
  </p>

  <div class="notice">
    <strong>Important:</strong> If you are looking for guaranteed profits, fast money,
    or someone to invest on your behalf, Trust ZedFund is not for you.
  </div>

  <h2>Who This Platform Is For</h2>
  <p>Trust ZedFund is designed for:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Individuals starting with small amounts (K100–K500)</li>
    <li>People who want to learn before risking money</li>
    <li>Communities that want transparency and structure</li>
    <li>Users who prefer clarity over promises</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Trust ZedFund is <strong>not</strong> for:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>People seeking guaranteed or fixed returns</li>
    <li>People who want passive income without involvement</li>
    <li>People uncomfortable with real-world risk</li>
  </ul>

    <li>We do not guarantee profits or outcomes</li>
    <li>We do not pressure anyone to contribute funds</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Learner / Observer Membership</h2>
  <p>
    This membership is for individuals who want to understand how collective saving
    and community projects work before participating financially.
  </p>

  <p>
    The membership fee exists because Trust ZedFund is a serious platform.
    It supports education, record-keeping, transparency tools, and platform operations.
    There are no free trials or test accounts.
  </p>

  <h3>What You Receive</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Structured financial education</li>
    <li>Real examples and case studies</li>
    <li>View-only access to how groups operate</li>
    <li>Simulated scenarios and learning tools</li>
    <li>Time to decide without pressure</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>What You Do Not Receive</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>No access to pooled funds</li>
    <li>No investment rights</li>
    <li>No promised or expected returns</li>
    <li>No obligation to upgrade or participate</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>About Money, Risk, and Value Growth</h2>
  <p>
    Trust ZedFund does not grow money.
    Any increase in value comes only from real economic activity chosen and managed by members,
    such as community projects or small businesses.
  </p>

  <p>
    If a project succeeds, members may benefit.
    If it fails, losses are possible.
    This is real life — not a financial product.
  </p>

  <h2>Fees and Fairness</h2>
  <p>
    Fees are charged for access to tools, education, and transparency —
    not for access to money or profit.
  </p>

  <p>
    Paying a membership fee does not make you an investor.
    It makes you an informed participant or learner.
  </p>

  <h2>Your Freedom and Right to Walk Away</h2>
  <p>
    You are free to leave Trust ZedFund at any time.
    We would rather lose a user than push someone into financial decisions
    they do not fully understand.
  </p>
